# Balloon

*By Ruyi Chen and Peiling Jiang*

Balloon Game is a paired game experience in which two players will be asked to keep the balloon flying in the tunnel for as long as possible by blowing into separate microphones to control a balloonâ€™s flying direction. The longer the game lasts, the higher the score will be.

We aim to create a collaboration atmosphere between two users by asking the two to finish a task together. And we are very interested in the way they will achieve the goal even under specific instruction. We realized some pairs will blow into the microphone while some pairs will make sound into the microphone, which later turns into conversations or arguments with different volume level. This is not only a game but also an experiment on how pair will explore and enjoy an experience together.
